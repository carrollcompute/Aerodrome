Getting used to the AWS Amplify service, I just have to keep practicing all the steps for hosting a deploying a react application. Itegration with Github is working. Hosting a Rect application repository is simple enough. 

Learning how to create a backend that includes a GraphQL schema for database construction. GraphQL's counterpart is RESTful APIs. GraphQL schema provides to data models for the database, and is responsible for provisioning the database, as well as provides API endpoint with query parameters for data CRUD operations. 

I now have to figure out how to connect the frontend to the database. I think that the React App js classes have to make graphql calls to the api with the appropriate API key.
