# Deployment Strategy

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React: Continue using React for the frontend. It's versatile and works well for both small and large applications.

### Backend
- Node.js with Express: This is a lightweight and easy-to-use solution for building RESTful APIs. It integrates well with NoSQL databases and is JavaScript-based, which aligns with the React frontend.
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway: For an even more scalable and cost-effective solution, consider using AWS Lambda in conjunction with API Gateway. This setup allows running backend code in response to HTTP requests without managing servers.

### Database
- AWS DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It's a good fit for applications with a small user base and can scale up as needed.

### Authentication
- AWS Cognito: For handling user authentication and authorization. It's easy to integrate with both the frontend and backend and offers various features like user sign-up, sign-in, and access control.

## Migration and Integration Approach

1. Develop RESTful API:
   - Create a Node.js application with Express or set up AWS Lambda functions. These will handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for data, interfacing with DynamoDB.

2. Replace JSON File Usage:
   - Gradually replace the parts of the application where JSON files are currently loaded with calls to the API. Use Axios or the Fetch API in the React app to interact with these endpoints.

3. Set Up DynamoDB:
   - Design the database schema in DynamoDB. Initially, manually populate it with existing JSON data.

4. Deploy Backend to AWS:
   - If using Node.js with Express, deploy it on an EC2 instance or use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easier management.
   - If using AWS Lambda, deploy functions and set up API Gateway to expose them as HTTP endpoints.

5. Deploy Frontend to AWS:
   - Use AWS S3 for hosting the React application. It's a cost-effective way to serve static websites. Enable static website hosting on the S3 bucket.
   - Optionally, use AWS CloudFront to distribute content globally.

6. Integrate AWS Cognito:
   - Implement user authentication in the React app using AWS Cognito. This adds a layer of security and user management.

7. Testing and Transition:
   - Before fully transitioning, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all components (frontend, backend, database) work seamlessly together.
   - Gradually phase out the local JSON file usage as AWS components become stable and reliable.

8. Optimization and Monitoring:
   - Once deployed, use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
   - Optimize the application based on usage patterns and performance metrics.
